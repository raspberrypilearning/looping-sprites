## Reflection
How did you get on with your Looping sprites project? 

Return to the [Checklist](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/looping-sprites/1) and remind yourself what you have learned.

Is there anything you would do differently? 

You can always go back and improve your project whenever you have time. If you have a Scratch account and have shared the Lopping sprites project you have created, keep an eye out for comments others may have made about it.
