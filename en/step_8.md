## Reflect on your project

How did your looping sprites project go? Is there anything you would do like to improve? 

Remind yourself what you have achieved:

--- task ---
I used an `if on edge, bounce`{:class="block3motion"} inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop to make my sprite turn away from the edge of the stage
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop to make a sprite repeat code 
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I modified a costume in the paint editor
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used `rotation`{:class="block3control"} styles to change how my sprite rotates
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used `layers`{:class="block3looks"} to make it look like some sprites are in front of others
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I found a bug in my code and fixed it
--- /task ---

Demonstrating these skills will contribute to the [Scratch Beginner]() and [Citizen Maker]() badges. 

You can go back and improve your project whenever you have time. 

If you have a Scratch account and have shared your Looping sprites project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments which are negative or irrelevant.
