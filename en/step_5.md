## Add more sprites
Now you've got one sprite moving the way you want it to, let's add another. 

--- task ---
Duplicate your first sprite to create the starting point for the next. The code gets copied too which saves you time.

**Add me in: scratch-duplicating-sprite**

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Think about how this sprite will look different to the first sprite. 

Change the new sprite's costume, or edit the costume with the paint editor so that it looks different from your first sprite. 

**Add me in: scratch-paint-tool-basics**

How big should the sprite be? 
Which direction will it point in?
Will the sprite appear behind or in front or other sprites?

**Add me in: generic-scratch-layers**
