## Get a sprite moving
Now it's time to get your first sprite moving. You will start with one sprite and then add more. 

Each sprite will `move`{:class="block3motion"} within a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop. 

--- task ---
Think about how you want your sprite to move. For example, you might say "I want my sprite to move up and down the stage really slowly."
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add code to make your sprite move around the stage in a forever loop, bouncing off the edges of the stage. 

**Add me in: generic-scratch-if-on-edge-bounce **

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Change the speed and direction of your sprite to get the effect you want. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---
You may need to change the way your sprite's costume rotates when it moves to stop it going upside down.

**Add me in: scratch-rotate-costume **

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Is your sprite the size you want it to be? If not, adjust its size.

**Add me in: generic-scratch-change-size **

--- /task ---

**Tip:** It's easier to identify issues if you make one change at a time and then run your program.

Remember to keep running your project to test it. Is the program working as you had planned?
