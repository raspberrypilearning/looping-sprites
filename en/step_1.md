## Introduction
You're going to create a project to try and change someone's mood using sprites that move over a backdrop. You will choose a theme for your project such as relaxing, energising, funny, inspiring or something else - it's your choice and select sprites and a backdrop to suit the theme. You will invent an algorithm for each of the sprites.

### Skills you should have
To complete ths Looping sprites project you need to have the following skills:
- How to use costumes
- How to use the `forever`{:class="block3control"} block

You will have learnt these skills when completing [Butterfly garden](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/butterfly-garden).

You will now apply these skills to create your own project.

### What others have made

Go to the [Looping sprites](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27014672){target=_blank} studio where you can investigate projects created by others to get ideas for your project. 

Tip: 'See inside' a project to see the code.
