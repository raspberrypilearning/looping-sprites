Have a look at these [Looping sprites](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27014672){:target="_blank"} from the Raspberry Pi Foundation Scratch studio.

Click the green flag on a project to see the code run.

Click `See inside` below a project to investigate its code. Each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes each sprite's movement unique.

**Tip:** Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.
